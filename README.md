# Timer
This is a simple Python application that allows users to set a countdown timer. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the Tkinter library.

## Features

- The timer displays the remaining time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- The text color turns red during the last 3 seconds of the countdown.

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Enter the desired countdown time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
3. Click the "Start Timer" button to begin the countdown.
